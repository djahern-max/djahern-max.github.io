                In December of 2019 I graduated from UNH's Full Stack Web Development Coding Boot Camp.  Working as a CPA since 2013, I have gained some valuable work experience as you will see from the positions outlined below.  However, I have always had an interest in coding and I have a creative side that I like to express through web development.  My goal is to obtain an entry-level position with a digital marketing agency so that I can build my web development skills further and take my abilities to the next level.
