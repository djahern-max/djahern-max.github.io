                <h3>The company I worked for had a furniture line called "Ply Furniture."  I thought it would be cool to create an e-commerce site to advertise the products.  This was a very in depth project that gained me a lot of experience working with the command line and Mongo DB.  Deploying the site through Digital Ocean was a challenge but the process of working through deployment and addressing bugs was very valuable. The foundation of this site could easily be used as a template to build other e-commerce sites for different applications.</h3>

                <h3>My daughter, Claire, wanted to create an e-commerce app and I wanted to start teaching her how to code!  So, we dug into another Udemy tutorial and created this app.  The tutorial was 15 hours in total length and I watched most of it 2-3 times to try to understand fully how everything worked.  It was a great experience to learn and to begin to introduce programming concepts to my daughter.  I am convinced whe will start the next Facebook!</h3>

I wanted to find a way to compare the watchlists over time to pick up on trends.  So, not unlike most people, I simply went to Udemy and banged out an 18.5 hour tutorial called "Make a YouTube Clone from Scratch" so that I could post videos of my watchlists spanning over several days.  I realize that these videos might be a little boring, but I envision this website as an online collaboration tool where stock market enthusiasts post videos of research and ideas to share with others.  </h3>

                <h3>This was my final project in Coding Bootcamp.  The idea behind this was to create a tool that for people to "exercise their minds."  We thought it would be good for people that have cognitive disorders or learning disabilities.  As a result, there is an administrator login and a user login.  Our plan was to have "users" work through various games while doctors or therapists, etc. monitored their patient's progress.  I was the team leader in this project and I played a big role in motivating my team to contribute and learn.  I am most proud of the Tetris game which is coded completely from scratch using JavaScript.  You can certainly tell we were all just learning as we built this but we gained a lot of great experience and had a lot of fun!</h3>
